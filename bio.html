                    <p>Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[5] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[6][7][8] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[9] He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,[10] with some German, Irish, Scottish,[11][12][13][14][15] Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.[16] In July 2012, Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch, an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.[17][18] Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. (1936–1982),[19] was a married[20][21][22] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.[20][23] Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.[24][25] The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.[26][27]

                        In late August 1961, a few weeks after he was born, Barack and his mother moved to the University of Washington in Seattle, where they lived for a year. During that time, the elder Obama completed his undergraduate degree in economics in Hawaii, graduating in June 1962. He left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at Harvard University, where he earned an M.A. in economics. Obama's parents divorced in March 1964.[28] Obama Sr. returned to Kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the Kenyan government as the Senior Economic Analyst in the Ministry of Finance.[29] He visited his son in Hawaii only once, at Christmas 1971,[30] before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when Obama was 21 years old.[31] Recalling his early childhood, Obama said, "That my father looked nothing like the people around me—that he was black as pitch, my mother white as milk—barely registered in my mind."[25] He described his struggles as a young adult to reconcile social perceptions of his multiracial heritage.[32]

                    <h3>Death of Osama bin Laden</h3>
                    <p>Starting with information received from Central Intelligence Agency operatives in July 2010, the CIA developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of Osama bin Laden. He was living in seclusion in a large compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles (56 km) from Islamabad.[432] CIA head Leon Panetta reported this intelligence to President Obama in March 2011.[432] Meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, Obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a "surgical raid" to be conducted by United States Navy SEALs.[432] The operation took place on May 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin Laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound.[433][434] DNA testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin Laden's corpse,[435] which was buried at sea several hours later.[436] Within minutes of the President's announcement from Washington, DC, late in the evening on May 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the White House, and at New York City's Ground Zero and Times Square.[433][437] Reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.[438]</p>

                    <h2 id="pres-campagin">Presidential campaigns</h2>
                    <p>On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois.[186][187] The choice of the announcement site was viewed as symbolic because it was also where Abraham Lincoln delivered his historic "House Divided" speech in 1858.[186][188] Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War, increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system,[189] in a campaign that projected themes of hope and change.[</p>

                    <h2>Post-presidency (2017–present)</h2>
                    <p>Obama's presidency ended at noon on January 20, 2017, immediately following the inauguration of his Republican successor, Donald Trump. Obama and Biden attended Trump's inaguration.[500][501] After the inauguration, Obama lifted off on Executive One, circled the White House, and flew to Joint Base Andrews.[502] The family currently rents a house in Kalorama, Washington, D.C.[503]

                        On March 2, 2017, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum awarded the annual Profile in Courage Award to Obama "for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage".[504] In his first public appearance out of office, Obama appeared at a seminar at the University of Chicago on April 24. The seminar was aimed at the engagement with a new generation as well as an appeal for their participation in politics.[505] On May 4, three days ahead of the French presidential election, Obama publicly endorsed centrist Emmanuel Macron over right-wing populist Marine Le Pen: "He appeals to people's hopes and not their fears, and I enjoyed speaking to Emmanuel recently to hear about his independent movement and his vision for the future of France."[506] Macron went on to win the election.
                        
                        While in Berlin on May 25, Obama made a joint public appearance with Chancellor Angela Merkel where he stressed inclusion and for leaders to question themselves. Obama had been formally invited to Berlin while still in office as part of an effort to boost Merkel's re-election campaign.[507] Obama traveled to Kensington Palace in England and met with Prince Harry on May 27, 2017; Obama tweeted afterward that the two discussed their foundations and offering condolences in the wake of the Manchester Arena bombing that occurred five days prior.[508]</p>
