                    <h2>Early life and career</h2>
                    <p>
                        Obama was born on August 4, 1961,[5] at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.[6][7][8] He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.[9] He was born to an American mother of European descent and an African father. His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas; she was mostly of English descent,[10] with some German, Irish, Scottish,[11][12][13][14][15] Swiss, and Welsh ancestry.

                    <h2>Presidency</h2>
                    <p>
                        The inauguration of Barack Obama as the 44th president took place on January 20, 2009. In his first few days in office, Obama issued executive orders and presidential memoranda directing the U.S. military to develop plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.[219] He ordered the closing of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp,[220] but Congress prevented the closure by refusing to appropriate the required funds[221][222][223] and preventing moving any Guantanamo detainee into the U.S. or to other countries.[224] Obama reduced the secrecy given to presidential records.[225] He also revoked President George W. Bush's restoration of President Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy prohibiting federal aid to international family planning organizations that perform or provide counseling about abortion.
